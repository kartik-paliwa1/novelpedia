# This is where we transform our Genre model into a format that can be easily sent over the internet.
# It's like preparing our genres for their big debut on the web! ðŸŽ¤

# --- The Genre Serializer: The public face of our genres! ---
# This serializer determines what genre information we share with the world.

# And that's our genre serializer! Short, sweet, and to the point.
# Now, let's see it in action in our views! ðŸŽ¬
